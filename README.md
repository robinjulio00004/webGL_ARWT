Example Augmented Reality (AR) Webpage made by me with Unity & ARWT

Previously we must generate the image and pattern and put inside each folder: markers->number_43.patt & markersImages->number_43.jpg 
We donÂ´t forget to set up Generic Controller Script: Marker To Listen=number_43 and drag and drop the model in child

In this example shows a target (number 43 as target) and work credential is displayed
